This project is designed for two users' sides. One is for Administrator with userid "admin" and password "password" to login, and the other is for student with userid (the same as student id, e.g. 100001) and password "pass" to login.

Once the administrator has added a new student into the system, it would automatically generate a student's account so the new student can login in the system with userid (student id) and password "pass".
